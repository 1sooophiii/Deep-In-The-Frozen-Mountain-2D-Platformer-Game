## Description 
### Deep in the Frozen Mountain is 2D platformer adventure game, taking place in a beautiful small magical village with wooden houses near the wild green forest of a fantasy world called Ignya. The village’s power source, a magical crystal, starts to lose its energy and our adventurers, Tera and Kev, need to find the frozen mountain to obtain a new crystal and save the village and its people.They will have to travel a long way until they reach the mountain, and overcome many obstacles in their way, as well as enemies who will have to be stopped in order to obtain the crystal and save their village.

## Features
### •	The player can switch between the two characters, Tera and Kev, with the button X. Tera has a ranged attack and Kev has a melee attack.
### •	The player can move left and right using the A and D buttons, as well as jump with W.
### •	The player can press E to read the story and in-game tips, shown in the game’s UI.
### •	The player can press the escape button at any time in game, in order to access the options menu and either restart level, resume game, adjust the volume or quit game, depending on the button they click. 
### •	The other two UI elements of the game are the player’s health bar and also a timer in some scenes.
### •	The player can attack enemies using the space button.
### •	The player can take collectibles, either potions that restore health, or slow time clocks, that slow time for a few seconds, green potions that make the player move faster and orange potions that make the player attack with bigger damage.
### •	The player can use the items by pressing 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively, regarding the item they want to access from the inventory.
### •	The player can access portals, which will take them to other areas.
### •	The player can shop items regarding to the XP they have collected, and to add them to their inventory.
### •	If the player dies, they have to start over the same level (same scene). 
### •	When starting the game, the player is in the village, reading the story. Moving on, the player travels in the forest day and night, until they finally reach the mountain. The forest has various enemies to be killed. After the player defeats the boss of the mountain, the last level of the game, the crystal will be revealed, and then the player can collect it. When they do, the game is completed, and the player goes to the village, where they can shop items and start over. To end the game, they should press escape and quit, or go to the left of the screen where they can press E to Exit.
### •	All assets used for the game, from sprites to music, are my own creation, except of the font I used in game which is called Press Start 2p and I found from google fonts. I created the pixel art in the software called Aseprite, and edited the music and the sounds I composed with the music software Logic X Pro.
